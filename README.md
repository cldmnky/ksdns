# ksdns

An Operator for serving delegated zones that can be updated using rfc2136 (dynamic updates)


## Description

`ksdns` consists of two components: 

* `zupd`which is a CoreDNS based plugin that enables RFC2136 (Dynamic Updates) DNS operations. upd` stores it's state in Kubernetes and have a controller and a *Custom Resource* which keeps state. A typical `Corefile` for the dynamic-update plugin would look like:

  ```Corefile
  example.org:1053 {
				prometheus localhost:9253
				tsig {
					secret  example.org <base64 encoded key>
					require all
				}
				dynamicupdate ` + zupdName + `
				transfer {
					to * 
				}
			}
  ```
  `zupd` requires a kubeconfig to be run in-cluster to start. `zupd`must run with leader election enabled if running more than one replica. It should also use `TSIG` for security when handling updates.
  
* The `ksdns-operator` that deploys and manages `zupd` deployments. A typical deployment consists of a `zupd` deployment with frontfacing CoreDNS replicas with the secondary plugin enabled.

## Use Case

`ksdns` can provide "service domains" for clusters. A service domain is a delegated domain that may be used by external-dns to update records dynamically. This also enables the use of cert-manager to provide public let's encrypt certificates for internal services.

### Getting started

1. Register a domain in AWS R53 (Or any supported provider for cert-manager)
2. Deploy `ksdns` and setup a delegated zone pointing to the `CoreDNS` service external-ip.

    ```zone
    blahonga.me NS  Simple                      -   xxx.awsdns-62.co.uk.
                                                    xxx.awsdns-62.net.
                                                    xxx.awsdns-40.com.
                                                    xxx.awsdns-28.org.
    blahonga.me SOA Simple                      -   xxx.awsdns-62.co.uk. awsdns-hostmaster.amazon.com. 1 7200 900 1209600 86400
    
    ksdns.blahonga.me   A   Simple  -   192.168.1.1 ; glue record pointing to ksdns
    service.blahonga.me NS  Simple  -   ksdns.blahonga.me ; delegated domain
    ```

    Create the zone object for ksdns:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rfc1035.ksdns.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Zone
    metadata:
        labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: zone
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: zone-service.blahonga.me
        name: service.blahonga.me
    spec:
    zone: |
        ; service.blahonga.me zone
        $ORIGIN service.blahonga.me.
        @                      3600 SOA   ksdns.blahonga.me (
                                    zone-admin.blahonga.corp.  ; address of responsible party
                                    20160727                   ; serial number, not used
                                    3600                       ; refresh period
                                    600                        ; retry period
                                    604800                     ; expire time
                                    1800                     ) ; minimum ttl
                              86400 NS    ksdns.blahonga.me.
    ```

3. Deploy external-dns in a cluster and setup a RFC2136 provider using the `zupd` service.
4. Deploy cert-manager and setup dns verification for the public zone in R53.

External-dns will now create records in the (internal) delegated zone for the cluster. The records should be resolvable form the internal network only.

If you need a let's encrypt cert, request a cert for a record in `ksdns`. Cert-manager will setup the DNS verification in the public R53 zone and `ksdns` will make sure that the service is resolvable inside your network.

zone: blahonga.me in R53, <cluster>.service.blahonga.me delegation setup in R53, pointing to the `ksdns` `CoreDNS`deployment.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
 
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/ksdns:tag
```
 
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/ksdns:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
